    "In this section, we perform an exploratory analysis of the `superstore_sales` dataset using SQL queries. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the data. Each query addresses a specific business question and is designed to provide actionable information for decision-making.\n",

    "### Key Questions Explored:\n",
    "1. **Total Sales by Region**: Which regions generate the most sales?\n",
    "2. **Top Product Sub-Categories**: What are the top-performing product sub-categories by sales?\n",
    "3. **Top Customers**: Who are the top customers contributing to revenue?\n",
    "4. **Sales Trends Over Time**: How have sales evolved monthly?\n",
    "5. **Most Popular Ship Modes**: Which shipping modes are most frequently used?\n",
    "6. **Sales by City**: Which cities contribute the most to sales?\n",
    "7. **Delivery Times**: What are the average delivery times for different shipping modes?\n",
    "8. **Sales by Customer Segment**: How do customer segments contribute to sales?\n",
    "9. **Top Products**: Which products are the best sellers?\n",
    "10. **Regional Sales Contribution**: What percentage of total sales does each region contribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each query is followed by its result.\n"

    "## Running Queries in pgAdmin\n",
    "\n",
    "The following SQL queries are designed to explore the `superstore_sales` database. Before running these queries, the user must ensure the database is properly set up by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Instructions:\n",
    "1. Run the `main.py` script to create and load the initial `sales_data` table into PostgreSQL.\n",
    "2. Open the `DB_normalizing.ipynb` notebook and execute the database normalization queries in **pgAdmin** to normalize the database structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Details:\n",
    "- **Database Name**: `superstore_sales`\n",
    "- **Host**: `localhost`\n",
    "- **Port**: `5432`\n",
    "- **Tables**:\n",
    "  - `sales`: Contains transactional data and order details (e.g., sales, order dates, product IDs, customer IDs).\n",
    "  - `customers`: Contains customer information (e.g., name, segment).\n",
    "  - `products`: Contains product details (e.g., name, category).\n",
    "  - `locations`: Stores geographical data (e.g., region, state, city).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Execution:\n",
    "Once the database setup is complete, you can use the provided SQL queries in **pgAdmin**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Execute Queries:\n",
    "1. Open **pgAdmin** and connect to the `superstore_sales` database using the above details.\n",
    "2. Execute the SQL queries provided in this notebook or your EDA workflow.\n",
    "3. Review and export the results as needed for further analysis or visualization."
